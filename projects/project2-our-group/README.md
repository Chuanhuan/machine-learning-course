#### About

Requirements:
- TensorFlow > 0.12.rc1 
- trainig images must be inside this folder i.e. ./training
- test images must be inside this folder    i.e. ./test_set_images

We have a two phase neural network, the main operation is CNN.run() e.g. in run.py:
cnn.run(phase=1, train=True, conv_layers=config.CONV_LAYERS)
means run phase 1, training (True) or testing (False), and the number of convolutional layers (default 2)

#### To perform training:

1. edit ./run.py
2. uncomment the two rows that call cnn.run(phase=X,train=True) ie:
   cnn.run(phase=1, train=True)
   cnn.run(phase=2, train=True)
3. execute 

#### To run test data prediction:

1. edit ./run.py
2. uncomment the row that calls from the phase 2 (less noisy) or phase 1 outputes cnn.run(*,train=False) ie either:
   cnn.run(phase=1, train=False
   or
   cnn.run(phase=2, train=False)
   (requires folder ./tmp containing model, if not available is generated by previous calls)
2. execute ./run.py

#### To generate submission.csv

1. edit run.py
2. uncomment the folder that does CSV generation from the output of the previous Test data set ie:
   generate_submission_csv_file(train=False, phase=2)
3. file is now output as ./submission.csv
